# IRIS-EDA
EDA and visualization of the Iris dataset using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

#Objective:
Perform EDA and understanding od the Data of Iris Dataset using Python Libraries.Main Theme of this task is to understand the structure, distribution and relationship among present features inside the dataset

#Dataset Information:
**Columns**:4 numerical features with 1 extra feature by name "flower area"
**Features**:Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, Petal width, flower area

#Tools used:
-Python
-Matplotlib
-Seaborn
-Numpy
-Pandas

#Execution:
1. Loaded the dataset and checked its structure (.shape, .head())
2. Verified data quality (nulls, data types, descriptions)
3. Visualized relationships using:
**Scatter plots** (e.g., petal length vs width)
**Box plots** (to find spread and outliers)
**Histograms** (to check distribution)
**Heatmaps** (correlation matrix)
5. Created a new feature (flower area) for deeper exploration

#Output:
1.Petal length and widht had a strong correlation, which allowed a new feature "flower area" to be made to find the maximum area and minimum area of a flower
2.certain features do have few outliers in them
3.Visuals, speciallty scatter plot, showed clear distinguishable and classification of flower types
